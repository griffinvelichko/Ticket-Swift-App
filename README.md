# Ticket-Swift-App

I created this Swift App alongside the following tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wYZZNwT0sE&t=5877s) with some changes of my own in order to learn MongoDB Realm. This App allows the user to Register or Sign-In. It then allows the user to post or update Tickets for different products which is live synced across all other users.
