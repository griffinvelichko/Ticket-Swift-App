# Swift App with MongoDB Device SDK

## Overview

This Swift application was developed to explore and implement key features of the MongoDB Device SDK. The app allows users to register or sign in and post or update tickets for various products, with real-time synchronization across all users.

## Features

- **User Registration & Sign-In:** Users can create accounts or log in to existing ones.
- **Real-Time Ticket Management:** Users can post or update tickets for different products. All changes are instantly synced across the app, ensuring that every user has the latest information.

## Skills and Technologies

This project was built as a learning exercise, focusing on the following skills:

- **Swift Programming:** Gained hands-on experience in Swift for iOS app development.
- **MongoDB Device SDK:** Implemented MongoDB's Device SDK to handle user authentication and real-time data synchronization.
- **Real-Time Data Handling:** Learned techniques to sync data across multiple users in a live environment.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open the project in Xcode.

3. Install the Realm-Swift Package Dependencies [Realm-Swift Repo Link](https://github.com/realm/realm-swift).

4. Build and run the project on the IOS simulator.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed following a tutorial available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wYZZNwT0sE&t=5877s). I made several modifications to the tutorialâ€™s original implementation to better understand and apply the MongoDB Device SDK in a real-world scenario.
